# NovaNet: Next-Generation Vision System
NovaNet is an innovative computer vision project designed to push the boundaries of image and video analysis using standard 2D cameras. With advanced AI-powered algorithms, NovaNet processes visual data to provide unparalleled object detection, context understanding, and scene analysis in real-time.

Features
Multi-Frame Super Fusion (MFSF): Combines multiple frames to create high-resolution "meta-frames" for improved object detection.

Adaptive Scene Understanding (ASU): Recognizes objects and their contextual significance within the scene.

Temporal Neural Memory (TNM): Tracks object movements across frames for precise motion prediction.

Light Optimization AI (LOAI): Handles challenging lighting conditions, such as shadows or overexposure.

Real-Time Processing: Optimized for low-latency analysis using GPUs, TPUs, or standard CPUs.
